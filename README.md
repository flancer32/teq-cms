# @flancer32/teq-cms

TeqCMS is a minimalistic content management system for building and maintaining multilingual websites.  
It is file-based by design and treats content as code — stored, versioned, and deployed using standard development tools.

Localization is powered by AI and fully integrated into the content lifecycle. When a page is updated, translations are automatically synchronized using language models, without manual duplication or third-party interfaces.

This system eliminates the need for databases, admin panels, or headless infrastructure. Instead, it relies on structured directories, template rendering, and automation — providing full transparency and control over every stage of development and publishing.

TeqCMS is suitable for websites, landing pages, documentation, and developer-facing resources where clarity, consistency, and maintainability are critical. It integrates easily into existing Git workflows and can be deployed in any Node.js environment.
